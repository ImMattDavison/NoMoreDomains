<h1 align="center">NoMoreDomains</h1>
Need to stop buying domain names? No More Domains blocks all the best known domain registrars and domain name auction sites to help you stop buying so many domains!

## How It Works

NoMoreDomains checks the URL of every site you visit to see if it is one of over 20 listed, known registrars. If the URL matches one of the listed registrars NoMoreDomains will make an immediate redirect away from that site to Google. While the extension is active you will not be able to access any of the listed registrars. 

## The Future

NoMoreDomains is only in early development, we plan to add a redirect to a branded page eventually and create a website for NoMoreDomains. As NoMoreDomains is opensource we rely solely on contributions to build this chrome extension. If you wish to make a contributions please visit the issues and find issues that need assistance or create one of your own!
