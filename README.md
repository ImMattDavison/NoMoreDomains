**Need to stop buying domain names?**

NoMoreDomains blocks all the best-known domain registrars and domain name auction sites to help you stop buying so many domains!


## How It Works

* NoMoreDomains checks the URL of every site you visit to see if it is one of over 600 listed registrars with [ICANN](https://icann.org) accreditation. You can view the entire list of registrars [here](https://github.com/immattdavison/NoMoreDomains/blob/master/domains.json).

* If the URL matches one of the listed registrars NoMoreDomains will make an immediate redirect away from that site to Google. While the extension is active you will not be able to access any of the listed registrars.

## Why?

I have spent at least the past year constantly browsing for and registering domain names and I noticed many other devs also do this. After seeing a tweet asking for something along the lines of this, I thought why not and set to it. That's how it began. 

Hacktoberfest 2022 came around during the very early stages of NoMoreDomains and I saw this as a chance and ceased it. One PR became 100 and now we have a functioning extension that works with most chromium based browsers. 

## The Future

* NoMoreDomains is only in early development, we plan to add a redirect to a branded page eventually and create a website for NoMoreDomains. As NoMoreDomains is open source, we rely solely on contributions to build this Chrome extension.
